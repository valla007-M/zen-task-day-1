HTTP:
 HTTP=>stands for HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL& ans it is used in CLINT-SERVER communication. several stages  of development of HTTP are there. but, mainly focus on HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1:
 1.it was created in 1997.
 2.Ithe usest workson the TEXTUAL FARMAT.
 3.there is head of line blocking that blocks all its requests behind it until it doesnot get its all resources.
 4.it was requests resources Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
 5.it compresses data by itself.
 6.loades resourcesone after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

HTTP/2:
 1.it was created in 2015
 2.it works on the BINARY PROTOCAL
 3.it allows multiplexing so one tcp connection is required for multiple requestes.
 4.it uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
 5.it uses HPACK for data compression.
 6.http2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
