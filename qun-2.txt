
OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JS
 OBJECTS=>1.in javascript is its most important DATA TYPE.
 2.and forms the building blocks for modern javascript.
 3.objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of the PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE as well as reference DATA TYPE.
 4. NON PREMITIVE DATATYPE=>array,object=>call by reference.
 5.we can use SPREAD operator to avoid call by reference.
 6.object=>
    1.an object
    2.an array
    3.JSON
    4.CLASS
    5.OOPS
 7. keys&values
 8.key will be unique.
 9.latest key value pair will be considered if the key is COMMAN.
 10.we can take value with the help of KEY.
 11.key should be =>1.string 2.number 3.boolean 4.null 5.undefined=>this is called primitive data type=>we cannot iterate.
 12.to FETCH all the key at once =>OBJECT.KEYS(OBJ);
 13.to FETCH all the value at once OBJECT.VALUES(OBJ)
 14.it will be only inside the {}.
 15.in objact we use multipul keys:values,so we should use "," between the keys:values
 OBJECT FORMAT:
  var obj={"key":"value","key1":"value1","key2":"value2","key3":"value3"}

how to fetch one value in the obj=> obj[key1]=>output=>"value1"
